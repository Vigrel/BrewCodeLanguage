Lets brew a coffee

brew cup calculateBrewingTime(lungo coffeeType, cup desiredStrength) {
  cup baseBrewingTime;

  sip coffeeType same "espresso" {
    baseBrewingTime = 20;
  } 
  sip coffeeType same "drip" {
    baseBrewingTime = 120;
  } gulp {
    baseBrewingTime = 180;
  }

  cup time;
  time = baseBrewingTime + (desiredStrength - 5) * 10;

  pour time;
}

lungo coffeeType;
coffeeType = "drip";
cup strength;
strength = 7;
